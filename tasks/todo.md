## Pilotify UI Design Implementation - Phase 18 (Component Implementation)

This plan focuses on implementing the remaining core UI components and placeholder pages.

### TODO List:

- [ ] **Task 1: Re-create Placeholder Pages for Main Modules.**
    - Description: Create `page.tsx` files for Dashboard, Marketplace, Pilot Projects, Innovations, Reports, and Profile within their respective `app/` subdirectories. Add basic headings to each.
    - Impact: Provides navigable content areas.
    - Dependencies: None.

- [ ] **Task 2: Implement Basic Button Component.**
    - Description: Create a reusable `components/Button.tsx` component that implements the specified variants, sizes, and states from `DESIGN_GUIDE.md` (Interactive Elements - Buttons).
    - Impact: Standardized interactive elements.
    - Dependencies: None.

- [ ] **Task 3: Implement Basic Input Component.**
    - Description: Create a reusable `components/Input.tsx` component that implements the specified styles and states for text fields from `DESIGN_GUIDE.md` (Interactive Elements - Forms & Inputs).
    - Impact: Standardized interactive elements.
    - Dependencies: None.

- [ ] **Task 4: Final Build and Verification for Phase 1.**
    - Description: Run `npm run build` and `npm run dev` to ensure the application compiles and runs without errors, and visually inspect the newly implemented components and pages.
    - Impact: Confirms basic functionality and design adherence for the initial non-functional UI.
    - Dependencies: All previous tasks.
