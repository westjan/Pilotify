## Revert to Latest GitHub Version

This plan outlines the steps to revert the local repository to the latest version available on the remote GitHub repository, discarding all local changes.

### TODO List:

- [x] **Task 1: Fetch latest changes from remote.**
    - Description: Execute `git fetch origin master` to retrieve the latest state of the remote `master` branch without merging.
    - Impact: Updates the local knowledge of the remote repository.
    - Dependencies: Git.

- [x] **Task 2: Reset local repository to remote master.**
    - Description: Execute `git reset --hard origin/master` to discard all local changes and move the `HEAD` to match the remote `origin/master`.
    - Impact: All local modifications will be lost, and the repository will be in the same state as the remote `master`.
    - Dependencies: Git, Task 1.

- [x] **Task 3: Clean untracked files and directories.**
    - Description: Execute `git clean -fd` to remove any untracked files and directories from the working tree.
    - Impact: Ensures a completely clean working directory, removing any files not part of the committed history.
    - Dependencies: Git.

- [x] **Task 4: Verify repository status.**
    - Description: Execute `git status` to confirm that the repository is clean and matches the remote `master` branch.
    - Impact: Confirms the success of the revert operation.
    - Dependencies: Git.

### Review

*   **Summary:** Successfully reverted the local repository to the latest version from `origin/master`, discarding all local changes and untracked files.
*   **Security Best Practices:**
    *   This operation is a revert and does not introduce new code or configurations. It restores the repository to a previously committed state.
*   **Vulnerability Review:** No new vulnerabilities were introduced as a result of this revert. The repository is now in a known good state (as per the remote).
*   **Confirmation:** The revert operation was successful, and the repository is clean.
