## Review

### Code Implementation and Security Review (2025-07-16)

*   **Summary:** Created a placeholder user profile page and linked the user avatar in the top navigation to it. Added a "Tasks" link to the left sidebar navigation.
*   **Security Best Practices:**
    *   No hard-coded secrets, API keys, or sensitive information were added.
    *   No personally identifiable information (PII) is handled by these components.
    *   Input validation is not applicable at this stage as the components use placeholder data.
*   **Vulnerability Review:** No common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) were introduced. The changes are primarily to navigation and placeholder pages and do not introduce any new security risks.
*   **Confirmation:** The implemented changes are secure and do not introduce any known vulnerabilities.
