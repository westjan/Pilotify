## Review

- Installed `lucide-react` for iconography.
- Refactored `LeftSidebar.tsx` to include icons for navigation items and a user profile section at the bottom.
- Refactored `TopNavbar.tsx` to align navigation items to the right and added a search bar.
- Refactored `page.tsx` to improve the main content area's visual appeal with example cards and recent activities.
- Updated `tailwind.config.ts` to enable dark mode.
