ðŸŽ‰ feat: Project reset and core UI setup

This commit represents a full reset of the Pilotify project, followed by the successful re-initialization of the Next.js application and the implementation of its core UI layout.

Key changes include:
- Complete deletion and re-creation of the `pilotify-app` directory.
- Successful integration and verification of Tailwind CSS.
- Implementation of the base application layout, including the left sidebar and top navigation bar.
- Resolution of various build and runtime errors encountered during the setup process.

This establishes a stable foundation for future UI development.
