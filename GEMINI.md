## 🧠 Project Overview

**Pilotify** is a B2B web application that streamlines collaboration between corporate entities and innovative startups during the pilot phase of new projects.

**For Startups:**  
Pilotify includes an AI module that transforms product information and marketing materials into best-practice formats, making them easily understandable for corporate clients. This helps startups present their solutions more effectively and increase their success rates.

**For Corporates:**  
Pilotify ensures that pilot projects are structured and aligned with internal documentation, regulations, and policies. It also facilitates clear communication and engagement among stakeholders, with features similar to social media interactions like likes and shares.

**Marketplace:**  
One of the standout features is a categorized **marketplace**, where startups can publish harmonized pilot offers. These offers are commercially standardized, enabling corporates to easily browse and compare across different solution categories.

### Key Features:
- 🧭 **Pilot Structuring** – Define and communicate pilot goals and expectations early.
- 🔄 **Ongoing Support** – Enable smooth follow-ups and collaboration during the pilot.
- 🛍️ **Marketplace** – Allow startups to publish and corporates to browse offers in a harmonized format.
- 📊 **Review & Outcome Evaluation** – Capture, assess, and standardize learnings at the end of pilots.

🎯 **Goal**: To make the pilot process more efficient, engaging, and successful for both startups and corporates by providing structure, clarity, and a dynamic discovery engine.


## Code Editing Instructions for Gemini CLI

You are a careful, methodical assistant working in a real-world codebase where simplicity and traceability matter.

### Step-by-Step Workflow:

1. **Understand First**  
   - Read through the relevant parts of the codebase to understand the problem before proposing or making any changes.

2. **Plan Before Code**  
   - Draft a clear plan and write it to `tasks/todo.md`.
   - The plan should include:
     - A checklist of discrete, atomic TODO items.
     - Each task should be as minimal and isolated as possible.

3. **Check-in Before Starting**  
   - Do **not** start making changes until the plan has been confirmed by me.
   - Wait for approval before proceeding.

4. **Implement with Simplicity**  
   - After approval, begin working through the TODO list one item at a time.
   - Mark each completed item in `tasks/todo.md`.
   - Keep changes as small and focused as possible.
   - Avoid large-scale or complex refactors.

5. **Communicate Clearly**  
   - For each completed task, write a brief, high-level summary of what was changed and why.
   - Output this in the CLI, not just in `todo.md`.

6. **Review and Wrap-up**  
   - At the end, append a `## Review` section to `tasks/todo.md`:
     - Summarize all completed changes.
     - Mention any follow-up considerations or questions.
     - Note any deviations from the original plan and why.

### Style Guide
- Prefer clear and readable code over clever solutions.
- Name variables descriptively.
- Follow conventions already used in the project.
- Use inline comments only when necessary for understanding context.

💡 Reminder: every change must be justified by its simplicity and minimal risk of introducing bugs.
